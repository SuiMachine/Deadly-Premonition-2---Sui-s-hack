# Intallation
* Download [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases) and install it (prefably using installer).
* Download the [Sui's Hack](https://github.com/SuiMachine/Deadly-Premonition-2---Sui-s-hack/releases) and extract it to game directory (do not change the file structure SuisHack.dll goes into "Mods", "Prompts" directory to a game's "StreamingAssets" folder etc.)
* Launch the game.
* Press F11 to open configuration GUI or close the game and edit "MelonPreferences.cfg" inside the UserData folder.

# Bugs / To do:
* Bug - occasionally when using interpolation, the player just starts hovering in mid air. Generally not a big problem.

* Replacing gamepad prompts requires generally requires modifying Steam Input profile, you generally want:
   * Xbox's A / DualShock's Cross to be the game's (Switch) B.
   * Xbox's B / DualShock's Circle to be the game's (Switch) A.
   * Xbox's X / DualShock's Square to be the game's (Switch) Y.
   * Xbox's Y / DualShock's Triangle to be the game's (Switch) X.
